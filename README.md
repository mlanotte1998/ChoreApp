# ChoreApp

Project that was started at the Rocket Software Hackathon in Boston from April 13th - 14th by Michael Lanotte and William Wallace. 

This is still in progress. 

### General Idea

Every college student has ran into issues with their roommates not being able to decide who does certain chores. One person will say they took out the trash last, and one will say that they have bought the last few things of toilet paper, and these arguments go on forever. 

Solve these issues with the Roommate Chore App!! 

Add all of the roommates and any chores that people argue about doing or buying. 
Run the chore wheel on a certain chore and it will decide which roommate needs to do it. 
The app will keep track of recent times that each roommate has done chores, and a level 1-3 can be input for each chore to distinguish the challenge or price of that certain chores. The more sever chores a person has done recently, the lower percentage they have of doing the next chore. 

### Current App Status

Currently, the app is in a state where roommates and chores can be added and they are stored on the app so when the app is opened again they will still be there. 

Next objective: Implement the wheel to work with equal probabilities for each roommate. 
Next-next objective: Implement the backend algorithms and data that alters the probability that a certain person has to do the next chore.
